            <li><a href="https://www.google.com">google something</a></li>
            <li><a href="./pages/about.html">go to about page</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit">read here about better git commit messages</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>summary of what makes a good git commit msg</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Keep the subject line to 50 chars or less</li>
            <li>Put a space between the subject line and the rest of the msg</li>
            <li>capitalize the subject line</li>
            <li>use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
            <li>in the message body, talk about what change was made and why it was made, not how it was made</li>
            <li>don't end the subject line with a period</li>
            <li>wrap lines in the body at 72 characters</li>
        </ol>
        <p>so, again, that's:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the subject line from the body with a space</li>
            <li>limit your subject line to 50 chars</li>
            <li> don't punctuate subject line</li>
            <li>use imperative mood in subject line</li>
            <li>wrap lines in body text at 72</li>
            <li>capitalize the subject line</li>
            <li>in the message body, answer why the change was made and what it was made on, vs. how it was made (use source comments for that)</li>
        </ol>
